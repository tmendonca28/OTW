# Level 7
There was a hint after I viewed the page source:  
hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8  
I also noticed that when clicking  between the home and about pages, it was changing a query in the URL between *home* and *about*. Decided to drop the file path in the hint in the query field.
